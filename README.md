# FreeGames
Website for freegames for desktop(windows) or web written with JS, DOM, HTML, CSS, Grid. The api used is a free API from www.freetogame.com

Because of the CORS Policy and because heroku isn't free anymore I had to save the data from the API in a JSON File and changed it from being dynamic to static.
